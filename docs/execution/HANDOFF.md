# Task Handoff — append-only log

Never edit or replace an earlier entry. The block between the explicit BEGIN/END markers is an exemplar, not an entry. Copy only the content between the markers (not the markers), replace every placeholder, and append that copy after all prior entries. Never fill or edit the exemplar or an earlier entry.

## `<Task ID>` — `<complete | blocked | stopped — CI NOT RUN>` — `<UTC timestamp>`

- Phase ID / phase branch / card position / phase-boundary card (`yes | no`):
- Phase-autopilot state / exact authorized same-phase span:
- Predecessor IDs and evidence:
- Outcome:
- Exact build-plan path / SHA-256:
- Exact implementation-runbook path / SHA-256 / selected card:
- Authoring host OS/build:
- GitHub repository / visibility and private-solo branch-control posture / base branch / phase branch:
- Integrated/base SHA `M` and evidence (within phase: prior green implementation; phase start: green `main`; `S0.1`: bootstrap `B` and predecessor iOS run N/A):
- Observed task-start authority SHA `A` and `M..A` authority-only diff result:
- Implementation commit SHA (the CI `head_sha`):
- Pre-existing dirty paths and owner/disposition:
- Workflow path / workflow file SHA-256 / trigger / frozen branch ref / actual expected ref-head SHA observed after `I`/`I2` and immediately before dispatch:
- CI selector task ID / tier / `runUISmoke` / workflow input equality result:
- Actions run ID / URL / `head_sha` / conclusion:
- Runner image / Xcode version+build / minimum iOS:
- Project or workspace / target / shared scheme / configuration:
- Simulator selector and actual model / OS / UDID; UI-smoke mode:
- Allowed GitHub/MCP tool methods and exact repository/ref/workflow arguments/operations from task:
- Owner-required posture from task and G0-observed effective sandbox / approval / command-network / trusted-config / GitHub-tool state:
- Card-owned implementation commit / phase-branch push / dispatch / inspection authorizations and actions actually performed:
- Owned launch-smoke IDs:
- Project/persistent-schema delta actually used:

### Verification

| Command or smoke | Run/job | Timeout | Exit code | Actual duration | Result | Artifact/evidence path and checksum |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---|---|
| | | | | | | |

Confirm that the successful run's `head_sha` exactly equals the implementation commit SHA. A stale or different-revision run is not evidence. This entry is not part of that implementation commit. With enabled phase autopilot and transition flag `yes`, Codex may later commit it together with only the immediate next same-phase CURRENT_TASK; at a boundary it commits the entry alone only when the boundary flag is `yes`, then stops. Immediately before either non-force bookkeeping push, the remote phase ref must still equal accepted `I`/`I2`; immediately afterward it must equal the new bookkeeping commit. A mismatch stops. Otherwise it leaves the entry uncommitted and stops. This entry never records the future commit SHA that contains itself: the next G0 observes transition authority, while git history records phase-close bookkeeping.

### Acceptance results

- Golden path `PASS | FAIL | NOT RUN` and checkpoints:
- Named alternate `PASS | FAIL | NOT RUN` and checkpoints:
- Accessibility spot check `PASS | FAIL | N/A—N8 changed no user-facing control | NOT RUN`:
- Exact terminal screen/data artifact `PASS | FAIL | NOT RUN`:
- Future controls verified omitted/inert `PASS | FAIL | NOT RUN`:

### Known bugs or limitations

- Bug ID / severity / disposition, or `NONE`:

### Blockers

### Next unstarted task

- Task ID only; it was not started:
- Next gate:
  - Within phase, autopilot enabled and transition flag `yes`: if the immediate next card is inside the exact span and uniquely resolvable, Codex commits/pushes only this HANDOFF append plus that next CURRENT_TASK, then runs fresh G0; a false flag or ambiguity leaves the append uncommitted and stops.
  - Phase boundary: when the boundary flag is `yes`, Codex commits/pushes this HANDOFF append alone and stops; otherwise it leaves the append uncommitted and stops. Owner merges the phase branch; under the private-solo rule, owner alone verifies `refs/heads/main` points to the expected merge SHA, permits no intervening push/history rewrite, dispatches `main` with `run_ui_smoke=true`, and requires a green matching `head_sha`; unexpected movement stops; owner prepares the next phase.
